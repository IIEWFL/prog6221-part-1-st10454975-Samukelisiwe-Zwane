# Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot - Part 1

## Overview

This project implements a basic console-based chatbot designed to raise awareness about cybersecurity. It provides a friendly greeting, interacts with the user, offers predefined responses to common cybersecurity questions, and includes basic input validation. The chatbot's user interface is enhanced with multimedia elements such as a voice greeting, an ASCII image, and coloured text formatting. This project also demonstrates the use of GitHub for version control and Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this part of the assignment, i am now able to:

* Write a console program that requires user input in C#.
* Apply string manipulation techniques to solve programming problems.
* Utilize automatic properties in C# for efficient code.
* Incorporate voice greetings into console applications using `System.Media`.
* Display ASCII art for visual enhancements in console applications.
* Implement basic response systems.
* Perform input validation.
* Enhance console user interfaces with coloured text, spacing.
* Use GitHub for project version control.
* Set up and verify a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions.

## Features

* **Voice Greeting:** A welcoming voice message plays when the chatbot starts.
* **ASCII Image Display:** A cybersecurity-themed ASCII art logo is displayed upon launch.
* **Personalised Text Greeting:** The chatbot asks for the user's name and uses it in subsequent interactions.
* **Basic Cybersecurity Responses:** Provides answers to questions about password safety, phishing, and safe browsing.
* **Input Validation:** Handles empty or unsupported user inputs with a polite prompt.
* **Enhanced Console UI:** Features coloured text, spacing, borders, and potentially a typing effect for a more engaging experience.
* **GitHub Version Control:** The project's development history is tracked with at least three meaningful commits.
* **Continuous Integration (CI):** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically checks the code for basic requirements (syntax, formatting, build) on each commit.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ` open gitbash
    git clone https://github.com/IIEWFL/prog6221-part-1-st10454975-Samukelisiwe-Zwane
    cd ProgAssignPart1
    ```

2.  **Ensure .NET SDK is Installed:** This project is written in C#. Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

3.  **(Optional) Configure Audio Playback:** Ensure your system can play WAV audio files. The `System.Media` namespace in C# is used for this purpose.
